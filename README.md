## Introduction

In this repository we explore the SEC XBRL API.

SEC API: [SEC.gov | EDGAR Application Programming Interfaces ](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation)

Example calls:
https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK0001018724.json
https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK0001018724.json

We need to find the CIK for a given company. It can be found here: [SEC.gov | EDGAR Company Filings | CIK Lookup ](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/cik)

## Getting Started
